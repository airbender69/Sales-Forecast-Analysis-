# Seasonal Sales Forecast Analysis
This project focuses on forecasting seasonal product sales across multiple retail stores using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Using Kaggle’s Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting dataset, it analyzes historical daily sales data that exhibit clear seasonal patterns. The data is preprocessed by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical features. Time-based variables such as month, day, and day of the week are engineered to capture seasonality. A Random Forest Regressor is then trained to predict future sales, achieving strong accuracy based on metrics like Adjusted R² and RMSE. Finally, visualizations of predicted trends for top-performing stores and product categories highlight the model’s ability to capture and forecast seasonal sales behavior effectively.
